# Improved_Solution_TSP
Traveling salesman problem is one of the NP-Hard problems. One of the methods to solve is a Greedy Approach. Greedy approach tries to find out the local optimal solution hoping to get a globally optimal solution. This solution can be further optimized by adding 2-opt approach. This project demonstrates optimized Traveling Salesman Problem
